## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I undertook this project, which was easier than the first project I tackled, because I specifically wanted something simple to work on for the purpose of understanding how certain ways of writing simpler CSS worked For example, I tried to define the colors of the document in :root, as well as the fonts and their respective weights, and just called them back with var() when I needed them. I also avoided having to include the font files in the project folder by linking the fonts instead. If I had tried to do it with a more difficult project, I might have gotten swamped with trying to make it work and wouldn't have gained as good of a grasp as I have. Being what it is though, it didn't take me long and I achieved exactly what I wanted, and I think my code looks much cleaner when compared to my first foray into CSS.

### Continued development

I'll want to keep using the techniques I learned in this project in all my future projects, so I'll want to work on them continuously.

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to Karthik, I actually saw how you used these techniques in another project and got curious about trying them out myself. Looking at your code really helped me learn a thing or two.
